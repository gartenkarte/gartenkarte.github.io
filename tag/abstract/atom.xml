<h1>Berliner Gartenkarte</h1>

<h2>a collective mapping initiative</h2>

<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;This is science. It just doesn&rsquo;t look like it.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>

<h6><em>Bernd Hilberer, Cartograph at Free University Berlin, September 28th 2013, at Allmende-Kontor community garden.</em></h6>

<hr />

<p>Berlin is known for its historically unique free spaces (<em>Freiräume</em>). Due to the morphogenesis of urban space after the Fall of the Wall, the city was scattered with temporary uses and squats. Despite people are constantly demanding their <em>Rights to the City</em> until nowadays, this development is in decline.</p>

<p>As an attempt to continue public participation in shaping (in the sense of <em>gestalten</em>) urban life worlds (<em>Lebenswelten</em>), activists are eager to create, maintain and publicise urban gardening initiatives. The <em>Berliner Gartenkarte</em> is a collective mapping initiative, formed by local students and researchers in collaboration with the urban agriculture community, that intends to visualize the gardens' spatial distribution.</p>

<p>When the students programming and designing the map were asking within the activist network for spatial garden data, they ran into open doors: As the round table &ldquo;Urban Gardening in Berlin&rdquo; already articulated its need for such a map, together with the ZALF (Leibnitz-Zentrum für Agrarlandschaftsforschung / <em>Leibnitz-Center for agricultural landscape research</em>) and the Allmende-Kontor, they took the volunteered geographic information aggregated in the soon-to-be-released community hub <a href="http://stadtacker.net">stadtacker.net</a> as a data source to their self-defined geoinformatics project. After negotiations about data licencing and collaborational details, the data got condensed into a webmap prototype, still to be found in its original form at <a href="http://gartenkarte.de">gartenkarte.de</a>.</p>

<p>The print design took the data even further: After a five month episode of collecting, refining and visualizing the dataset, a DIN A0 Creative Commons map has been sent to the printer. Subsequently, at a round table meeting during spring, twenty tarps and a hundred posters were distributed within the community. In addition is the original printing document always available at <a href="http://gartenkarte.de/gartenplane/">gartenkarte.de/gartenplane</a>.</p>

<p>This recapitulation conveys the collective bottom-up production of a community-driven map that displays urban agriculture and &ndash; gardens in Berlin. Additionally it will position the authors' work within the field of critical cartography and inherently reflect on action research principles plus the map&rsquo;s meaning to the movement itself.</p>

<p>Outlining current development vectors and speculating about the meaning of webmapping generally, within the nexus of <em>open source</em>, <em>self-organization</em> and <em>data visualization</em>, broadens the scope. And because the mapping process has yet to finish, an euphoric conclusion about the field of collective cartographic representations is at the end of the argument.</p>
